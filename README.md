# Customer Support Chatbot Using BERT and NLP Libraries

## Overview

This project implements a **Customer Support Chatbot** leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques with **BERT** and complementary machine learning tools. The chatbot is designed to understand, classify, and respond to customer queries efficiently, improving user engagement and support quality.

Key features include:
- Use of **BERT embeddings** for semantic understanding.
- Integration of traditional ML classifiers for intent classification.
- Preprocessing and text analysis using **NLTK**, **spaCy**, and **scikit-learn**.
- Data handling with **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- Model training and evaluation with **TensorFlow** and **scikit-learn**.
- Visualization of performance metrics using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Hosting an interactive chatbot interface via **Gradio**.

Installation

Set up the project environment by installing all required dependencies. You will need Python 3.8 or higher. Libraries include NLTK, spaCy, Gradio, TensorFlow, Transformers, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib. Additionally, download the English language model for spaCy to enable text preprocessing.

Dataset

The model requires a labeled dataset of customer support queries paired with their corresponding intents. The dataset should be formatted with at least two columns: one for the user query and one for the intent label. This structured data serves as the foundation for training the chatbot’s intent classification model.

Preprocessing

Preprocessing involves cleaning and normalizing the text data to enhance model performance. The text undergoes tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal, utilizing tools such as NLTK and spaCy. Features are then extracted using the TF-IDF vectorization method. Labels are encoded for compatibility with machine learning algorithms, and the dataset is split into training and testing subsets for model evaluation.

Model Architecture

The chatbot’s intent classification is approached using two complementary methods:

A Random Forest Classifier applied to TF-IDF vectorized text as a strong baseline model.
BERT embeddings extracted through the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provide contextualized word representations that capture semantic nuances. These embeddings can then be fed into a neural network classifier built with TensorFlow.
This hybrid approach leverages classical ML simplicity and transformer-based contextual power.

Training

Training encompasses fitting the models to the processed dataset. The Random Forest model is trained on the TF-IDF vectors to learn intent classification boundaries. Alternatively, a deep neural network is trained on BERT embeddings with dropout and dense layers to improve generalization. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs are tuned to optimize performance.

Evaluation

Model evaluation is conducted using standard classification metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The sklearn library facilitates generation of detailed classification reports to analyze performance per intent class. Visualization of results through Matplotlib and Seaborn aids in understanding model strengths and areas for improvement.

Deployment

The trained chatbot model is deployed as an interactive web interface using Gradio. This interface accepts user text input, processes it through the preprocessing and prediction pipeline, and returns contextually appropriate responses mapped from the predicted intent. The deployment supports easy local hosting and can be extended for cloud or public deployment.

Usage

To use the chatbot, launch the project’s main script or notebook which initializes the Gradio interface. The user inputs queries into the provided text box and receives intent-aware, predefined responses from the chatbot. This interface simplifies end-user interaction and testing during development.

Future Work

Potential extensions to enhance this project include:

Supporting multiple languages using multilingual spaCy pipelines and BERT variants.
Adding sentiment analysis to gauge user emotions and tailor responses accordingly.
Incorporating continual learning from user feedback to adapt and improve over time.
Developing dynamic, generative response capabilities for personalized interactions beyond fixed intent replies.
